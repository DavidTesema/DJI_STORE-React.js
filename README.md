## Architecture

- BLL (Business Logic Layer): The BLL encapsulates the core functionalities and business rules of the application, driving the behavior of the E-commerce DJI Drone Project.

- DAL (Data Access Layer): The DAL interacts with the database and handles data operations. In this project, Mongoose is used as the DAL, simplifying object modeling and database interactions.

The BLL and DAL components provide a structured and modular architecture. The BLL implements business rules, while the DAL handles data access, ensuring separation of concerns and improving code organization and maintainability.

These components, along with Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, React.js, Redux, Material-UI, Three.js, and SCSS, work together to create a robust e-commerce solution for DJI drones.
